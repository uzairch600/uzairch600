Iâ€™m a Full Stack Engineer (MERN) with 5+ years of hands-on experience building scalable web applications and SaaS platforms. Since 2019, Iâ€™ve been crafting premium, turnkey digital solutions â€” always custom-engineered from the ground up, never template-based.

My expertise spans MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js, and extends into AI integrations and UGC ad strategies that help businesses not only launch but scale with real impact.

Iâ€™ve delivered projects for SMEs and startups across diverse industries, and my experience includes working with Al Satwah Group as well as leading my own agency, Zair Web Studio. This background gives me the ability to manage projects from concept â†’ launch â†’ growth, ensuring every product is both technically sound and commercially valuable.
